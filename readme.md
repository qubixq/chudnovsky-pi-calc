# Chudnovsky Pi Calculator

This is a hobby project born out of my curiosity about how the earliest computers performed mathematical calculations — like computing Pi to many digits — and how today’s home computers handle similar tasks.

Back in the early days, computers spent a lot of time on heavy numerical calculations, and Pi digit computation was a popular challenge to test their limits. I wanted to see, with modern hardware, how many digits of Pi I can calculate using the Chudnovsky algorithm while keeping the system stable and responsive.

The program automatically detects your system’s RAM and CPU speed, then recommends a safe maximum digit count based on available resources. You can customize the digit count, live preview speed, and block size for updates as the digits get calculated.

Once finished, it presents a detailed report including runtime, average CPU usage, frequency, RAM consumption, and system information. You can also save the full Pi digits and stats to a text file and open it in your preferred editor.

- This project is mainly a personal experiment — combining math, system resource awareness, and Python programming — to connect with the roots of computing and challenge modern machines. Contributions are welcome but not expected. Feel free to use or modify it however you like!
